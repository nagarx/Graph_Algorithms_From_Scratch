Graph algorithms are indispensable tools in computer science, aiding in solving complex problems across various domains such as social networks, transportation, and more.
## Overview of Graph Algorithms
Graph algorithms are a set of techniques designed to analyze and solve problems on graph-structured data. These algorithms are foundational in computer science and mathematics, enabling efficient solutions to complex real-world issues. Whether it's finding the shortest path in a transportation network, ranking web pages, or social network analysis, graph algorithms are at the core.
### Importance of Implementing Algorithms from Scratch
Implementing these algorithms from scratch provides not only a deep understanding of the underlying logic but also the flexibility to adapt them for specialized use-cases. This repository serves as both an educational tool and a customizable base for researchers and developers.
## Algorithms
### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Breadth-First Search is one of the simplest algorithms for searching a graph and the archetype for many other graph algorithms. It starts at the root node and explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
#### Complexity
##### Time Complexity:
$O(V+E)$, where $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ is the number of edges.
##### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is $O(V)$ due to the usage of an additional data structure, usually a queue, to hold vertices.
##### Parallelization
BFS can be parallelized efficiently using techniques like level-synchronous algorithms, which can further reduce the effective time complexity when implemented on multiple cores.
##### Optimizations
Various optimizations like Bidirectional Search can be employed to speed up the search process under specific conditions.
#### Use-Cases
- Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph
- Crawlers in Search Engines
- Network Broadcasting

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
Depth-First Search is another fundamental algorithm in graph theory, which is often used in scenarios where we need to explore all the vertices along a single branch before backtracking.

## Introduction to BFS
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes in the order of their distance from the source node, where distance is measured by the number of edges on the shortest path from the source node. BFS begins at a source vertex and inspects all the neighboring vertices. Subsequently, for each of those nearest vertices, it explores their unexplored neighbor vertices, and so on.
### Mathematical Foundations
Graph Representation: BFS can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs. A graph $G$ can be represented as $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of edges.
- Adjacency Matrix: $M[i][j]=1$ if there's an edge between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$, else $M[i][j]=0$.
- Adjacency List: For each vertex $v$, its neighbors are stored in a list.
Queue: BFS utilizes a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure called a Queue. Vertices are enqueued and dequeued as BFS progresses.

BFS Tree: BFS produces a BFS tree, which can be represented as $T=\left(V, E_T\right)$, where $E_T \subseteq E$. It shows the connection between vertices as they are explored by BFS.

### Algorithm Complexity
#### Time Complexity:
BFS visits each vertex exactly once and examines each edge once or twice (undirected graphs). Therefore, the time complexity is:
$$
O(|V|+|E|)
$$
where $|V|$ is the number of vertices and $|E|$ is the number of edges.
#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity depends on the data structures used:
- For the queue used in BFS, in the worst case, all vertices might be in the queue simultaneously. Thus, the queue space complexity is $O(|V|)$.
- For storing the graph, if an adjacency list is used, the space complexity is $O(|V|+|E|)$.
- If an adjacency matrix is used, the space complexity becomes $O\left(|V|^2\right)$.
### Advanced Aspects of BFS
**Bipartite Testing**: BFS can be employed to check if a graph is bipartite. A graph is bipartite if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets where no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.

**Shortest Path**: For unweighted graphs, BFS provides the shortest path between the source vertex and any other vertex.

**Layered Approach**: BFS divides the graph into layers. The source vertex is layer 0, its neighbors are layer 1, and so on. This property can be utilized in various applications, such as network broadcasting.
### Use Cases of BFS:
- **Social Networks**: Finding people within a specific degree of connection.
- **Computer Networks**: Broadcasting in a network; BFS can help model this as it ensures minimal redundancy.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: BFS can be applied in 2D grids to find the shortest path, often used in games.
- **Web Crawlers**: BFS can help navigate the vast landscape of the web in layers.
- **Recommendation Systems**: By understanding the layers of connection, BFS can assist in making accurate recommendations.

## Introduction to DFS
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a pivotal graph traversal algorithm that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It starts at a source vertex and ventures deep into the graph following a path until it reaches an end, then retraces its steps and explores alternate routes.
### Mathematical Foundations
Graph Representation: DFS can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs. A graph $G$ is represented as $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.
- Adjacency Matrix: $M[i][j]=1$ if there's an edge between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$, else $M[i][j]=0$.
- Adjacency List: For every vertex $v$, its neighbors are kept in a list.
Stack: DFS employs a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure called a Stack. Vertices are pushed onto the stack as DFS progresses and popped when backtracking.

DFS Tree: DFS yields a DFS tree, which is defined as $T=\left(V, E_T\right)$, where $E_T \subseteq E$. This tree illustrates the relationships between vertices as they are traversed by DFS.
### Algorithm Complexity
#### Time Complexity:
Since DFS visits each vertex and examines each edge once, the time complexity is:
$$
O(|V|+|E|)
$$
where $|V|$ signifies the number of vertices and $|E|$ denotes the number of edges.
#### Space Complexity:
The space efficiency is contingent upon the structures used:
- The stack in DFS, in the worst scenario, might be populated with all vertices. Thus, the space complexity of the stack is $O(|V|)$.
- If an adjacency list represents the graph, space complexity is $O(|V|+|E|)$.
- Using an adjacency matrix results in a space complexity of $O\left(|V|^2\right)$.

### Advanced Aspects of DFS
**Topological Sorting**: On Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), DFS can facilitate topological ordering. This is crucial in scenarios like task scheduling.

**Cycle Detection**: DFS can be employed to discern cycles in a graph, which can be pivotal in numerous applications, such as detecting deadlocks.

**Connected Components**: In an undirected graph, DFS can assist in identifying connected components, which represent discrete clusters within the graph.

**Strongly Connected Components**: In directed graphs, DFS can be employed twice to pinpoint strongly connected components, an essential aspect in various graph applications.

**Path Finding**: DFS can locate a path between two vertices, but unlike BFS, it doesn't guarantee the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### Use Cases of DFS:
- **Maze Solving Algorithms**: DFS can be used to solve mazes, creating a path from start to finish.
- **Dependency Resolution**: Systems like package managers use DFS for topological sorting to determine the order of installations.
- **Circuit Design**: In electronic circuit design, DFS assists in determining the connectivity of components.
- **Garbage Collection**: Modern garbage collectors employ DFS to detect objects that are no longer in use.
- **Decomposition of Graphs**: DFS aids in decomposing graphs into their constituent parts, simplifying complex graph structures.
