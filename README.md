# Graph Algorithms Implemented from Scratch
This repository is a unique take on fundamental graph algorithms, implemented entirely from scratch, without relying on pre-existing libraries. This approach allows for a deeper understanding and a finer control over the algorithm's behavior. Graph algorithms are indispensable tools in computer science, aiding in solving complex problems across various domains such as social networks, transportation, and more.
## Overview of Graph Algorithms
Graph algorithms are a set of techniques designed to analyze and solve problems on graph-structured data. These algorithms are foundational in computer science and mathematics, enabling efficient solutions to complex real-world issues. Whether it's finding the shortest path in a transportation network, ranking web pages, or social network analysis, graph algorithms are at the core.
### Importance of Implementing Algorithms from Scratch
Implementing these algorithms from scratch provides not only a deep understanding of the underlying logic but also the flexibility to adapt them for specialized use-cases. This repository serves as both an educational tool and a customizable base for researchers and developers.
## Algorithms
### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Breadth-First Search is one of the simplest algorithms for searching a graph and the archetype for many other graph algorithms. It starts at the root node and explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
#### Complexity
- Time Complexity: $/sin$ , where $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ is the number of edges.
- Space Complexity: $O(V)$
